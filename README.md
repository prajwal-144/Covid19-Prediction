# Covid19-Prediction
CNN for predicting if a person is Covid positive or negative

#CNN

Convolutional Neural Network is a Neural Network that contains multiple convolutional layers. It deals mostly with image recognition and applies convolutional functions to input before transferring it to the next layer.

CNN  takes in an input image, assigns importance like learnable weights and biases to various objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other.

#Code

The code studies X-Ray scans of Covid positive and negative patients. The accuracy is 85% - 89%.
Total number of epochs is 20.

We can increase the number of epochs to 50 or 100 or even more to try to get more accuracy. Also we can tune the hyperparameters if necessary.
